#Project 1: 7 Segment Display

PROJECT STATUS : FINISH 

VERSION : 01 

With an electronics board created by the ETML-ES School and equiped with a FPGA, realization / Simulation of a programme in VHDL 
which allows to read a message in a message implemented in the FPGA (in the code - constant table) and to display the message on 
the two 7 segments display. The message rolls out at the 500ms (Time).

INPUT/OUTPUT

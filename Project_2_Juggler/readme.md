# Project 2 - Jungler

With an electronics board created by the ETML-ES School and equiped with a FPGA, realization / Simulation of a juggler with the both 7 Segments Display 

* Segments '''A''' / '''E''' / '''F''' of Display A will be used   
* Segments '''A''' / '''B''' / '''C''' of Display B will be used 
* Using of PEC12 to start the juggling  
* Reset to stop the juggling 
* 4 switches used for the mode of juggling   
* PEC12 to use the speed choice of juggling (to 0,5 Hz at 2 Hz)

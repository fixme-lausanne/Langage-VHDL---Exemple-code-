Project 1 - 7 SEGMENTS DISPLAY [DONE] : 

With an electronics board created by the ETML-ES School and equiped with a FPGA, realization of logic schemtatics concerning the 7 Segments dispaly (0 to F) under Quartus.

Project 2 - JUNGLER [IN PROGRESS - PART A -> DONE]: 

With an electronics board created by the ETML-ES School and equiped with a FPGA, realization / Simulation of a juggler with the both 7 Segments Display

Project 3 - JOYEUX NOEL [DONE] : 

With an electronics board created by the ETML-ES School and equiped with a FPGA, realization / Simulation of a programme in VHDL which allows to read a message in a message implemented in the FPGA (in the code - constant table) and to display the message on the two 7 segments display. The message rolls out at the 500ms (Time).
